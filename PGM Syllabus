Course Syllabus
Topics covered include:

The Bayesian network and Markov network representation, including extensions for reasoning over domains that change over time and over domains with a variable number of entities
Reasoning and inference methods, including exact inference (variable elimination, clique trees) and approximate inference (belief propagation message passing, Markov chain Monte Carlo methods)
Learning parameters and structure in PGMs
Using a PGM for decision making under uncertainty.
There will be short weekly review quizzes and programming assignments (Octave/Matlab) focusing on case studies and applications of PGMs to real-world problems:

Credit Scoring and Factors
Modeling Genetic Inheritance and Disease
Markov Networks and Optical Character Recognition (OCR)
Inference: Belief Propagation
Markov Chain Monte Carlo and Image Segmentation
Decision Theory: Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Dysplasia
Conditional Random Field Learning for OCR
Structure Learning for Identifying Skeleton Structure
Human Action Recognition with Kinect
