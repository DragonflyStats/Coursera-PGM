Introduction
This tutorial introduces belief propagation in the context of factor graphs and demonstrates its use in a simple model of stereo 
matching used in computer vision.
It assumes knowledge of probabili
ty and some familiarity with MRFs (Markov random fields), but no familiarity with factor 
graphs is assumed.
