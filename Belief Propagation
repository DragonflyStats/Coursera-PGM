Introduction To Belief Propagation
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------%
This tutorial introduces belief propagation in the context of factor graphs and demonstrates 
its use in a simple model of stereo matching used in computer vision.

It assumes knowledge of probability and some familiarity with MRFs (Markov random fields), but no 
familiarity with factor graphs is assumed.
