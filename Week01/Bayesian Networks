A Bayesian network is a graphical model that encodes probabilistic relationships among variables of interest. 
When used in conjunction with statistical techniques, the graphical model has several advantages for data analysis. 
One, because the model encodes dependencies among all variables, it readily handles situations where some data entries 
are missing. Two, a Bayesian network can be used to learn causal relationships, and hence can be used to gain 
understanding about a problem domain and to predict the consequences of intervention. Three, because the model 
has both a causal and probabilistic semantics, it is an ideal representation for combining prior knowledge (which 
often comes in causal form) and data. Four, Bayesian statistical methods in conjunction with bayesian networks offer an 
efficient and principled approach for avoiding the overfitting of data.
